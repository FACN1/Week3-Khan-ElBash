# Week3-Khan-ElBash

Khan El-Bash's week 3 app.

## Outline
Our app will:
- let the user enter a search term
- use the Open Movie Database (OMDb) API to get information about the film which is most relevant to the search term (according to OMDb)
- use the Giphy API to display GIFs relating to the film

## Initial Plan
- We brainstormed and used a coin flip to decide on which idea to go forward with
- We drew out some designs for the page
- We discussed the architecture and required files in the repo
- Build the skeleton files

## User Stories
A user logs on to the website and wants to search for their favourite film. They should:
1. Be able to easily use the search feature
2. See some basic information about the film
3. See some super cool gifs related to film
4. Be inspired to search for another film after such a great experience
5. Repeat



## Stretch Goals
- Make the search box autofill with films

## How did we do it?
- first we added the project file and build some skeletons for the modules.
- then we started working on html files.
- We started making tests for the modules and functions
- after the test building we started writing the functions.
- fixing some damn conflicts.
